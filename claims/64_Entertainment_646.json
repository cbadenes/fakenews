    "claim": "In  the film 'Cañitas' appeared on the big screen, portraying the most chilling case in a house in Mexico City, where there was a ouija in between and demons. But several years later one of the real protagonists of that event spoke about what happened and left Carlos Trejo as an authentic 'charlatan'.

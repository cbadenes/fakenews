Anabel Gomez Lopez is a tamalera from Mexico City that sold her food outside the metro station. However, thanks to an emergency call from one of the lady's neighbors; for her there was a gas leak in her home. When the authorities arrived, the escape was quite strong so they decided to break into the house and came across the surprise. Also in the room of his household were the bones of a young woman, from whom all the flesh had been taken away. It was collecting information with neighbors who could find the sale of Anabel Gomez and proceeded with the capture. In addition, once in police facilities, the lady confessed to having murdered more than  women; all to save herself a little money in the meat. The lady said the following:'The first time was a day I spent the investment, right?. And I didn't have to invest in meat and by coincidence I found a girl who got lost and looked for her parents. I took her to my house because from there I was going to talk to her parents to go get her; but the devil is devil and I said to myself, 'Anah, there is the flesh for your tamales'. And the girl never came home. '. He added,'That was the hard one. The rest of them have even taken away all their flesh; I was caught by the damn gas hose, as soon as I had changed it because 'Finally, Ana will face charges of homicide and health damage. Well, the people who consumed their tamales didn't know they were turning cannibals. I'm sorry.",

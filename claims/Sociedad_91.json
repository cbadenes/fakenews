    "claim": "Even though Mariah Carey is still the 'kingdom' of Christmas, artists like Ozuna, Luis Fonsi or Sebastian Yatra have wanted to create their own Christmas carols. Christmas is a time to become nostalgic, affectionate and romantic, but also to celebrate, dance and rejoice, even though this year is going to be an atypical holiday due to the coronavirus pandemic. But despite this, there is a classic that never changes and accompanies us every Christmas: it is the carol 'All I Want for Chritsmas is you' by Mariah Carey that after 26 years of this classic unappealable at this time and that every year makes him raise thousands and thousands of dollars, some artists have changed their usual format and have adapted to Christmas the way they best know how to do it. 'Christmas came', (Ozuna)Ozuna, the singer of songs like 'Caramelo' has released a carol, after joining in 2018 with 'Selected Generation' and Christian Nieves to release 'Christmas came'. A theme that transmits good vibration with a chorus of the most catchy. [[H3:'Santa Claus is Comin' To Town' (Sebastian Yatra)]]The Colombian has seen one of the classics of Christmas by the mythical Frank Sinatra, 'Santa Claus is Comin' To Town', to remember that it is time to return home, and to meet with their loved ones, even if this year is more complicated. 'Let it snow', (Luis Fonsi) Puerto Rican Luis Fonsi sings the classic 'Let it snow' and has also encouraged these parties to change their musical record. 'Like It's Christmas', (Jonas Brothers)They were one of the first artists to publish their Christmas song this year. 'Like It's Christmas' came as a way to announce that Christmas was already here. 'All I Want (For Christmas)' (Liam Payne)It's not a new version of Mariah Carey's legendary theme, but it does have to do with the artist. It's a song of lovelessness at Christmas. 'Merry Xmas Everybody', (Robbie Williams ft Jaime Cullum)British Williams also wanted to miss the Christmas repertoire and along with Cullum, they created a song of the best set at Christmas. 'Merry Christmas', (Thalia)Thalia celebrates the Christmas spirit and makes everyone dance at these parties with the premiere of her new single 'Merry Christmas'. 'El Ni単o del Drum', (Juanes)Juanes and Jay de la Cueva, premiere their version of 'El ni単o del Drum', carol that reinterpret with their particular style. I'm sorry.",

    "claim": "Great excitement and excitement has generated the next premiere of the new History Channel series “Tiranos de America”. The production, which had a budget of about 5 million dollars, focuses on the leaders of America who acceded to power in a democratic way and then seek to perpetuate themselves in it in a dictatorial way. Among the characters that will appear in the new stellar series of the History stands Nayib Bukele, who in a short time has managed to consolidate himself as one of the tyrannical figures of the continent next to characters like Castro and Chávez. The new program is said to be a full-body X-ray of populist dictators in the region, which is why the President of El Salvador himself has sought to avoid the issue of the series at all costs. I'm sorry.",

    "claim": "The councilor of the socialist municipal group of Alicante Llanos Cano left, this Thursday, September 26, amazed the rest of the buildings of the municipal Corporation of the Alicante capital, including those of their own formation to judge by their faces, when suggesting during the plenary that the macroburdeles of the city hire people with disabilities. And that surprising statement by Councilwoman Cano, it is not known whether to favor a collective like that of the disabled or to attend to a kind of sexual perversion of the future clients, has had its raison d'être (according to her) in the application of the legislation in force. Thus during the intervention of this socialist councillor on a joint motion of the PSOE, Podemos and Compromís against prostitution and trafficking of women (in which she has emphasized that the province of Alicante is the third of Spain in number of prostitution) has pointed out that news 42 of the General Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires that public and private companies that employ 50 or more workers will be forced among them 2 percent to be workers with disabilities. Our macroburdels would have to have disabled people working. Among the stupefying faces of the Llanos Cano Plenary Hall has followed its surprising argument in the form of repeated rhetorical questions: Can it be considered work that a group of women is an object of consumption for a part of the male population, the whores?Should the institutionalization of male sexual satisfaction be considered a job?Should the conversion of women into merchandise be considered a job?Can impunity for sexual violence from prostitution be eliminated when it is actually a constituent part of it?“If your answer is yes to any of these questions, I encourage you to value the next consequences, said Llanos Cano, considering that one of the main ones would be the obligation of alternes clubs with more than 50 workers to hire people with disabilities. Some of them are slowing down on the claim of rights and the interpretation of the law..",

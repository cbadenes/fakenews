    "claim": "Weather and climate conditions, including the onset of higher temperatures in the spring of the northern hemisphere, should not be used as a pretext to relax public health measures to stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, assures a report* of the World Meteorological Organization on weather and air quality factors affecting the COVID-19 pandemic. 'At this stage, knowledge (scientific) does not support the use of weather and air quality factors as a basis for governments to relax their interventions aimed at reducing transmission ', according to the co-chair of the research team, Dr. Ben Zaitchik, Department of Earth Sciences and Planetaries, at Johns Hopkins University, USA. 'We saw waves of infections that increased in warm seasons and warm regions during the first year of the pandemic, and there is no evidence that this cannot happen again next year ', he added. The dynamics of COVID-19 transmission in 2020 and early 2021 appear to have been influenced mainly by government interventions such as mask mandates and travel restrictions rather than weather factors, according to the panel of 16 members of experts in terrestrial and medical sciences and public health. Other relevant drivers include changes in human behaviour and demographics of affected populations and, more recently, virus mutations. The report analyses the potential role of seasonality. Respiratory viral infections often show some type of seasonality, particularly the fall-winter peak for influenza and coronaviruses that cause the cold in temperate climates. This has fueled expectations that, if it persists for many years, COVID-19 will prove to be a strongly seasonal disease. “The underlying mechanisms that drive the seasonality of respiratory viral infections are not yet well understood. A combination of direct impacts on virus survival, impacts on human resistance to infection, and the indirect influence of weather and season through changes in human behavior may be at stake,” says the report. “The laboratory studies of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have shown some evidence that the virus survives longer in cold, dry and low ultraviolet conditions.”. However, these studies have not yet indicated whether direct weather influences on the virus have a significant influence on transmission rates in real-world conditions,” according to the paper. Poor air quality increases deaths, but not transmissionThe evidence about the influence of air quality factors is not yet conclusive. There is some preliminary evidence that poor air quality increases mortality rates from COVID-19, but not that pollution directly affects the aerial transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the Task Force. The report focuses on meteorology and air quality conditions and does not address the details of air circulation in indoor areas. The Interdisciplinary and International Task Force was established by the Board of Inquiry of the World Meteorological Organization to provide a quick summary of the state of knowledge about possible weather influences and air quality in the dynamics of COVID-19, given the staggering number of documents and preprints currently available. “The rapid pace of COVID-19 research has meant that studies with limited data appeared faster than information could be compared and peer-reviewed. It soon became clear that the evidence reported was often contradictory or selective due to methodological and data-related deficiencies. Therefore, the Task Force seeks to promote good practices in research and communication,” says Prof. Juerg Luterbacher, Director of Science and Innovation and Head of the UN Agency. The future work of the Task Force will include updating scientific evidence over the coming months, identifying and promoting a structured set of priority research questions, objectives and priorities for investment in research in pandemic areas: climate, climate and air quality nexus. Researchers will also advise and report on good practices and minimum standards for integrated modeling methods for infectious diseases considering environmental determinants. The UN agency considers it equally important to maintain clear and active communication between researchers, the media and decision makers to ensure that scientific findings are applied to policies in an appropriate, objective, transparent and responsible manner.

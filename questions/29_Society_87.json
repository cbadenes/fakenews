    "claim": ", an initiative that offers us a tool to confront the flow of false news that is being generated by the ease of social networks to invent lies. The development of technology leads humans to have advantages and disadvantages in relatively short time, we have moved from the control of information through official lies in the media and rumors that were running slowly in society at the end of the s, to the ease that any 'citizen 'invents his own vision of things, that this news is true, biased or totally false, can be replicated from any mobile phone, having reach in unimaginable people, and that artificial intelligence algorithms are programmed to viralize and expand the reach of those messages. The objective of both situations remains the same, trying to impact society as a whole to modify social routine, of course it also has its advantages, such as achieving a more direct communication without intermediaries, but there is a degree of social paroxysm that generated reaching the concept of 'false news ', which are stories and contents with unverified information that runs through social networks and that people take them as real information causing disinformation and uncertainty, suddenly these realities began to be a daily matter. Fortunately for us in Mexico, last week the initiative called Verificado was born. mx , led by the digital newspaper Animal Política, in conjunction with universities and civil society organizations and more than  media, which will be given the task of being for the next four months, the flow of news to determine if they are false or not. This initiative has been in operation for more than a week and on its page you can already find a lot of denials to news that had gone viral as real news, today citizens should start our day by reviewing that it is false or not, before beginning to watch the news, in order to discard the false news of the previous days, entering the verified page. mx we can realize that the flows of false lies are huge and that the election campaigns are not yet beginning, imagine that for every candidate that is in contention there will be at least three or four opponents who will be inventing lies, this will be added to the three levels of government where people will be elected and will be able to imagine the amount of lies that will flood us. This system, through different technological tools, detects the news that goes viral at an unusual speed and reviews them, but also offers citizens the option to request the verification of a news item by tagging the news in question on Twitter with the hashtag: #I WanttoVerify. The verification action is a titanic work by the group created by this collective, but little by little the denials of the news that are impacting Mexican society the fastest begin to flow. Information and tools are now available, and citizens in a responsible and informed attitude need to consult and contribute to its use. This exercise is going to have a very powerful effect on the system of political, electoral communication and on the practice of the media and citizens. Today, a stream of denials is being created for false news. If we use it correctly, we can improve the information and the way we communicate with politicians, as it will be more difficult to tell lies in the media or in speeches. An example of how you can use this initiative happened to me last week in a chat of friends on WhatsApp, where all the participants before each meme immediately get disgusted in comments, one day someone put one of those fake news and the moment I read it, went to the verification and sent them the lie, the result was very curious and I sum it up as the famous phrase of the song'Ella 'by Jose Alfredo Jimenez, in the chat, 'the mariachis silenced'. Let's realize that each of us reporting correctly and not viralizing things that aren't verified can improve the flow of true information. I'm sorry.",

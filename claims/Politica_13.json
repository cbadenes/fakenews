    "claim": "The Spanish portal OKDIARIO reported that, after the published data on the payment of 272. 325 dollars by the regime of Nicolás Maduro to the secretary general of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, the latter was found guilty by the Spanish authorities. Apparently, Iglesias Turrion received the amount in an account in his name at the Euro Pacific bank of the tax haven of the Grenadines. In addition, the ruling of the highest court in Spain rejected the application of the Secretary General of Podemos against the same portal that disclosed the information, since, according to what was pointed out by the holder of the Court of First Instance number 84 of Madrid, the data did not infringe on his “right to honor”. The magistrate in charge sentenced Iglesias from the costs of the judicial proceedings, after a long trial that began on 6 May 2016. I'm sorry.",

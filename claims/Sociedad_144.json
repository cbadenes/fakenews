    "claim": "Feminist studies conducted by the Union of Feminists, Afroempowered and Oppressed of the Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo (UASD) showed that having sex during pregnancy is a micro-aggression to the fetus since during this time the fetus is disturbed by the attack of the virile oppressor and male aggressor member. This action can lead to future frustrations of the fetus (clarifying that it is a fetus because he has not yet chosen to which genus it will belong), and especially in the mother of the fetus, since she is a victim of society for being forced to be a mother and having to have sexual aggression again within her body. Finally they reported this Sunday that they were protesting at the head of the male obelisk, and they would ask for its elimination from the place where it is located as this is the greatest false and oppressive representation of patriarchy in our country. I'm sorry.",

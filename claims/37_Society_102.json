    "claim": "A serious altercation took place last week at a nightclub in Logroño, when a group of exalted young people climbed onto the diskjockey stand to pounce on him and punch him and kick him. The security forces were barely able to give enough and had to call the police who quickly came forward and arrested  of the attackers who were taken to the police station. One of them explained to the agents that the diskjockey had been playing the song of Luis Fonsi 'Despacito 'all night long, that they had warned him to stop putting it because they were already fed up but that he kept putting it in a defiant attitude. When he did ten, they couldn't take it anymore and went up to beat him for being heavy and for being cool. Despite the fact that the officers were sympathetic for the reasons they had to file the complaint because, as they were told, 'problems are not solved by beating'. I'm sorry.",

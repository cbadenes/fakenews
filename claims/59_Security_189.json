    "claim": "A new measure proposed by the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) will also force drivers and drivers' companions to blow in the alcohol test. According to the DGT it is good that even if the pilot did not drink there is another person in the vehicle free of alcohol in case during the trip the driver could feel indisposed. For drivers travelling alone this will not be taken into account, but those who are accompanied must pass the alcohol test so that at least one of the companions can count as an alternative driver.'We think it's the safest way to drive, no one knows if something can happen to the driver during the journey and it's good that there's always a co-driver available,'explains Alberto Bermúdez, DGT communication director. The new measure will be launched from the next  of July so that this summer we can have safer roads in our country. I'm sorry.",

    "claim": "The first fragrance designed for men and women who want to know what it feels like to live in Mexico City and also for the capitals who have had to leave the metropolis and miss the scent that can only be experienced at home. The creation of this product is due to the prestigious French house Parfumerie Fregonare Aix-en-Provence, and will be the sensation this summer. This reporter was sent to France to talk with Collete Cucomont, president of the Fregonare:'Our engineers have spent years trying to synthesize the traditional aromas of Mexico City, because we have seen that many people when they leave there, even smile when a truck smokes, as that reminds them of their city. That's why, after a lot of work, we finally made it and made the presentation of Eau de Chilang, the first fragrance made and designed for chilangos'. This fragrance, according to Cucomont, contains various aromas, such as gasoline, sweat of the metro in the afternoons, sweat and shepherd, pink venus, tamale and champurrado, as well as the classic Milanese cake with quesillo and chilaquil with egg; and, of course, guava and tamarind monkey, stadium beer and golden gut. 'The fixator of this fragrance is based on Resistol , so that the aroma is even more pleasant for those who use it, and feels that, no matter where it is, it will carry with it the essence of Mexico City ', added Madame Cucomont. The Fregonare house also prepares Changoleon, a lotion for after shaving, and an extra-concentrated perfume to be called Jamaicon * NUMBER*. I'm sorry.",

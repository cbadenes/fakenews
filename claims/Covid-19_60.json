    "claim": "In a recent interview by Bill Gates on the United States' CNBC channel, he publicly acknowledged a terrifying fact and advises governments to legally protect themselves from deaths that are necessarily going to occur as a result of the COVID-19 vaccine. In that interview, Gates states that the current vaccines do not work in the elderly, so the vaccine against the COVID-19 has to be truly effective and protect that segment of the population. However, vaccinating the population always leads to many deaths, so it is necessary to point to the least number of deaths possible from the vaccine. Getting only 1 in 10,000 people vaccinated to die, that would be a good result according to Gates. But as the vaccine is going to be mandatory, governments are going to have to protect themselves in some way and offer some kind of compensation due to the number of people who are going to die from the COVID-19 vaccine, which at best will exceed 770,000 deaths. I'm sorry.",

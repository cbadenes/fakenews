    "claim": "Fernando Simon told the press today that the state capital will end up in quarantine in the next few days. The Director of the Emergency Centre has confirmed that due to the increasing number of Covid infected, 87. 967 at present, it seems that containment measures are necessary. Likewise the development of the infection, increasing in hundreds of cases every day, seem to force to “take more drastic measures” to contain “the rebounds”. While it is true that the expert has not yet confirmed that this is going to happen, it has made an important nuance. “If the cases continue to grow it will be necessary to apply s drastic measures” that force the “social distance of security” so, and although it is not yet insured, nothing seems to intuit that the cases will stop suddenly. For the same reason it seems that Madrid will close in the next few days. I'm sorry.",
